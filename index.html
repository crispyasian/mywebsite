           <p>Hello welcome to the official Shakib page.  Question is who is Shakib Ishraq?  Shakib Ishraq is a normal brown boy that loves to goof around.  Although Shakib is goofy as ever he is very smart.  He's so intelligent that he taught himself how to create amazing swimming pools, oceans, rivers, and even lakes.  He creates these amazing bodies of water with his saliva.  He produces 54.3% more than the average human!  Some people say he's a myth, but they are truly wrong, he is real!  Legend has it that if you are lucky enough to spot Shakib Ishraq, he will grant you the ability to create swimming pools as well!</p>
